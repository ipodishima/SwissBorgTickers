#  SwissBorgTickers

## Installation and running

The projects relies on SPM to install dependencies. You can run it on both iPad and iPhone.

## Preview all views

Views have been designed with SwiftUI. You can preview them and their states
See for example

![success](./READMEResources/success.png)
![initial_refresh](./READMEResources/initial_refresh.png)
![loading_refresh](./READMEResources/loading_refresh.png)
![refresh_error](./READMEResources/refresh_error.png)
![initial_error](./READMEResources/initial_error.png)

## Known issues

Because I spent a bit too much time on the project and I had to stop at some point:
- The graph is not really efficient. It's only here because I wanted to test SwiftUI against the SwissBorg design.
- Not everything is unit tested, but the VM should be fine. I also tried to test the extensions amongst other things like the service, ...
- It was my first time using Moya so I might not be using it 100% correctly. It gave me some headaches regarding stubbing behavior
- The VM uses both Combine and RxSwift. RxSwift is more mature so I used it here but I still need to bridge it with SwiftUI using Combine. There might be more efficient way though.
- I usually use SwiftLint and/or SwiftFormat. But it's not the case here, I focused on delivering something rather than some project management. Same goes for code generation like Sourcery for UT helpers.
